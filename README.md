Description
-----------
This application displays traffic stops in the Montgomery County Maryland area over the last two years. The user has the ability to truncate the dataset to display where traffic stops occurred during fixed hours of the day and if they were alcohol related.

Using This Application
----------------------
To adjust the hours of the day that stops occurred, move the slider to the appropriate start and end times. To view all hours of the day, set the values to 0 and 24.
To view stops related to alcohol, click Highlight Alcohol Related Stops
The Draw Map button will create the map.
NOTE: Any update to the slider values will not update the map automatically. It is unfavorable to have the map automatically redraw if you need to adjust both numbers on the slider. To update the map, click the Draw Map button.

NOTE: The Highlight Alcohol Related Stops checkbox automatically refreshes the map when it is used.
